## Abstract

**Background**: Understanding the complexities of burn wound healing is essential
for developing better treatment strategies. The proliferative phase plays a vital
role in wound closure and long-term tissue remodeling after burn injury.
Purpose: This study aimed to develop a novel computational model using
coupled ordinary differential equations to predict the interactions between cell
types, cytokines, and key molecules during the proliferative phase of burn wound
healing.
**Methods**: A model was constructed using a system of equations that repre-
sent the interactions between fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages
type II, cytokines (TGF-β1 and IL-8), and collagen types I and III. Model sim-
ulations were run for 30 weeks and novel metrics were developed to evaluate
Inflammation, Collagen deposition(2D) and Contraction.
**Results**: The model successfully predicted realistic cell and molecular dynamics
during the proliferative phase. The key parameters influencing wound remodeling
after burn injury were identified as the initial counts of fibroblast / myofibrob-
last and initial collagen type III/I concentrations. Novel cellular and molecular
metrics were proposed to differentiate between normotrophic, hypertrophic, and
keloid scar development based on these parameters and ongoing inflammatory
activity.
**Conclusion**: This study presents a novel computational model that effectively
predicts cellular and molecular interactions and identifies crucial factors influenc-
ing wound closure during the proliferative phase and scar formation during early
remodeling phase of burn wound healing. The proposed metrics hold promise for
early scar type prediction, aiding in clinical treatment decisions.
